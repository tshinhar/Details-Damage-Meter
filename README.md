this is a simple fork of https://github.com/Tercioo/Details-Damage-Meter created mainly for educetional porpuses and expermentation.

as for the time being there is no benefit to using this fork (other then the github release) i would recommand using the original one.

this repo is automatically updated to match the source repo
